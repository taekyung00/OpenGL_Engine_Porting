     * \brief Complete shader program with uniform location cache for efficient rendering
     *
     * CompiledShader represents a fully compiled and linked OpenGL shader program
     * that's ready for use in rendering operations. This struct bundles the shader
     * program handle with a pre-computed cache of uniform locations, eliminating
     * the need for expensive uniform location lookups during rendering.
     *
     * Purpose and Benefits:
     * - Encapsulates the complete shader compilation and linking process
     * - Provides efficient uniform access through cached locations
     * - Simplifies shader resource management
     * - Reduces runtime overhead by avoiding repeated OpenGL queries
     *
     * The uniform location cache is particularly important for performance, as
     * calling GL::GetUniformLocation() during rendering can be expensive. By
     * pre-computing and storing these locations, uniform updates become much
     * faster during the render loop.
     *
     * Typical shader workflow:
     * 1. Create shader from vertex and fragment sources
     * 2. Use cached uniform locations for fast parameter updates
     * 3. Bind shader program for rendering operations
     * 4. Destroy shader when no longer needed
     *
     * Resource management:
     * Both the shader program and uniform location cache should be properly
     * cleaned up when the shader is no longer needed to prevent resource leaks.

     * Loads, compiles, and links a complete shader program from separate vertex
     * and fragment shader files. This is the standard approach for shader
     * development, allowing separate editing and version control of vertex
     * and fragment shader code.
     *
     * The compilation process includes:
     * - Loading shader source code from the specified files
     * - Compiling vertex and fragment shaders separately
     * - Linking both shaders into a complete program
     * - Extracting and caching all uniform locations for fast access
     * - Cleaning up intermediate shader objects
     *
     * Error handling and debugging:
     * If compilation or linking fails, detailed error messages are logged with
     * line numbers to help identify the problematic shader code. The function
     * throws exceptions for compilation errors, making shader loading failures
     * immediately apparent.
     *
     * File organization patterns:
     * - Vertex shaders typically have .vert extension
     * - Fragment shaders typically have .frag extension
     * - Shaders are located through the asset system for proper path resolution
     *
     * This approach is ideal for production code where shaders are stored as
     * separate files and can be modified without recompiling the application.

     * Compiles and links a complete shader program directly from source code
     * strings. This approach is useful for programmatically generated shaders,
     * embedded shader code, or when shader sources are loaded through custom
     * mechanisms rather than direct file access.
     *
     * The compilation process mirrors the file-based version:
     * - Compiling vertex and fragment shaders from provided strings
     * - Linking both shaders into a complete program
     * - Extracting and caching all uniform locations
     * - Proper cleanup of intermediate resources
     *
     * Use cases:
     * - Procedurally generated shaders with variable content
     * - Embedded shaders compiled into the executable
     * - Shader templates with runtime string substitution
     * - Loading shaders from compressed archives or custom formats
     * - Shader preprocessing and macro expansion
     *
     * Error handling:
     * Like the file-based version, compilation errors result in detailed logging
     * with line numbers and exception throwing for immediate failure detection.
     *
     * This approach provides maximum flexibility for dynamic shader generation
     * while maintaining the same performance characteristics as file-based shaders.

     * Usage patterns:

     * - Include in application shutdown sequences
     * - Use in RAII wrapper destructors for automatic cleanup
     * - Call before reassigning shader variables

     * - Share common data (matrices, lighting parameters) across multiple shaders
     * - Reduce driver overhead compared to individual uniform calls
     * - Enable more efficient uniform updates for large data sets
     * - Provide better organization of related uniform variables

     * The binding process:
     * - Locates the named uniform block within the shader program
     * - Assigns the block to the specified binding point
     * - Binds the uniform buffer to the same binding point
     * - Logs errors if the uniform block is not found

     * - Camera matrices (view, projection, view-projection)
     * - Lighting parameters (light positions, colors, attenuation)
     * - Material properties shared across multiple objects
     * - Time-based values for animations and effects

     * access the same uniform buffer data, enabling true data sharing.
